            <p class="pb-2" style="font-size: 19px;">Horrible things happen. Delaying an oil change can lead to a
              buildup of sludge and debris in the engine,
              which hampers its efficiency and can cause damage over time. The old, dirty oil becomes less effective at
              lubricating the engine parts, increasing friction and wear,
              potentially leading to overheating and accelerated engine wear. Over time, this can result in decreased
              fuel efficiency,
              as well as the possibility of severe engine damage.</p>

            <p class="pb-2" style="font-size: 19px;">An oil change at Deebs Auto Service is a 30-minute process that involves draining the old engine oil and replacing it with new oil. 
              Additionally, the service includes the replacement of the oil filter. This regular maintenance helps in maintaining engine efficiency and prolonging its lifespan. 
              The service is focused on ensuring the vehicle's engine operates with clean and effective lubrication.
